          <h4>Hospitals</h4>
          <p>
            Our team is accepted by multiple hospitals ranging from Utah to
            Arkansas. Seeing a hospital environment has a requirement to be
            clean and have fresh air, we ensure to keep dust and contaminats
            down. We have focused most of our operations in Tulsa, OK and
            Oklahoma City. Nearly all major hospitals in these areas hire
            Pro-Select for the flooring you will see at these hospitals.{" "}

          <h4>Schools</h4>
          <p>
            We work with schools to get their flooring needs fulfilled.
            Pro-Select will get your logo in your lobby or any designs wanted to
            make your building as spirited as possible. We can assist in
            renovating your building(s) as well as assist in getting you newly
            constructed building all ready to be walked on! We own machines to
            make the demo work quicker. All pre-existing flooring system gets a
            reboot by releveling and patch work where needed.

            Carpet, VCT, LVT, Ceramic, Sheet Vynal you name it! Rubber base
            installed as well for floor types that require the base. We can work
            from gym floors to sheet vynal hallways to ceramic for bathrooms.
            Give us the challenge and we will handle it with ease.
