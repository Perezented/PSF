          <h4>Hospitals, Clinics, Doctors Offices</h4>
          <p>
            Our team is accepted by multiple hospitals ranging from the states
            of Utah to Arkansas. Pro-Select Flooring understands a hospital
            environment has the requirement to be clean and contain fresh air,
            so we ensure to keep dust and contaminants at a minimum. We have
            focused most of our operations in the Tulsa, OK and Oklahoma City
            areas, with nearly all major hospitals in these areas hiring
            Pro-Select to get all flooring needs fulfilled.

          <h4>Schools, Churches, Businesses</h4>
          <p>
            We work with schools, churches, and all different kinds of
            businesses to get their flooring needs fulfilled. Pro-Select is
            capable of getting your school or business logo on your lobby floor
            and/or any designs throughout the building wanted to make your
            building as spirited as possible. We can assist in renovating your
            building(s) as well as assist in getting your newly constructed
            building all ready to be walked on for multiple years to come! We
            own machines to make the demo work quicker and have all pre-existing
            flooring systems get a reboot by releveling and patch work where
            needed.

          <h4>Multiple Flooring Types</h4>
          <p>
            Pro-Select Flooring is experienced with multiple flooring types and
            has been actively keeping up with the latest technologies. We can
            also go old school and work with something more classic if that is
            what is desired. We are comfortable with all floor types from
            Carpet, VCT, LVT, Ceramic, Sheet Vinyl, you name it, we do it!
            Rubber base is installed as well for floor types that require the
            base. You do not get half jobs marked as completed, you get the full
            package. We can work on gym floors, sheet vinyl hallways, to ceramic
            for bathrooms. Give us the challenge and we will handle it with
            ease.
